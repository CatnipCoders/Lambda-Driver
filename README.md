## 🚫 Why This Was Replaced

### Problems with version 1.0.1 Structure

1. **Two Models (1.5B + 7B)**
   - Confusing which to use
   - Wasted disk space (~10GB)
   - Different quality levels

2. **Fixed Storage Location**
   - Models in system cache
   - Hard to manage
   - Can't choose drive

3. **Mixed Setup/Runtime**
   - Setup and run combined
   - Scripts tried to download during run
   - Got stuck frequently

4. **Windows Only**
   - No Linux support
   - Platform-specific

5. **Complex Structure**
   - Files scattered
   - Hard to understand
   - Difficult to maintain

## 🗑️ Should You Delete This?

**Keep it if:**
- You want to reference version 1.0.1 code
- You're still using the version 1.0.1 structure
- You want to compare implementations

**Delete it if:**
- You need disk space

## 📊 Comparison

| Feature | Lambda Driver | NEW_STRUCTURE |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Models | 1.5B + 7B | Only 7B |
| Storage | System cache | User choice |
| Setup | Combined | Separate |
| Platform | Windows | Windows + Linux |
| Download | During run | During setup |
| Structure | Mixed | Clean modules |

## 🔄 How to Use version 1.0.1 Structure (Not Recommended)

If you still want to use the version 1.0.1 structure:

```bash
cd Lambda Driver/qwen_setup
install.bat
run.bat
```

Or:

```bash
cd Lambda Driver/hybrid_llm
install.bat
run.bat
```
